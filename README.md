# CKD_Diagnosis

This project is for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) diagnosis using machine learning.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aadunni/CKD_Diagnosis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CKD_Diagnosis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook model.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the CKD diagnosis model.

## Model Description

The model used for CKD diagnosis is a Logistic Regression model. It is trained on the UCI Machine Learning Repository CKD dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `new_model.csv`, which is a modified version of the [UCI Machine Learning Repository CKD dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease).
